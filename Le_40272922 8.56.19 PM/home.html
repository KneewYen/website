        <h3><u> About me: </u></h3>

        Hello, my name is Nguyen Le, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Concordia University, with an expected graduation year in 2027. 
        With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I bring a solid technical background to the table. 
        My past experiences as an Apple Sales Specialist and in sales and customer service at BestBuy have honed my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and effective communication. 
        I've successfully tackled challenging customer issues, worked with various technologies on a daily basis, and operated seamlessly with point-of-sale (POS) systems.
    
        Now, I am actively seeking a fall 2024 internship in roles related to software development, data analysis, and within fintech companies.
        My interests lie in the dynamic fields of technology, AI, and machine learning. I am eager to apply my skills and passion for innovation in a professional setting, contributing to projects that align with my aspirations and challenge my capabilities. 
        I am confident that my diverse experiences and technical expertise make me a valuable candidate for opportunities in your organization.
